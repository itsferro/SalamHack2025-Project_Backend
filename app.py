Rules:
1. Generate up to {num_meals} different meal options that meet the criteria. If you cannot create that many unique and appropriate meals, provide as many as possible.
1. The recipe must strictly adhere to all dietary restrictions specified by the user.
2. The recipe should fully respect the user's allergies and nutritional preferences.
3. Handle ingredient specifications as follows:

"""

4. For each meal, count how many ingredients are NOT in the user's "Ingredients Available" list and store this number in "extra_ingredients_count".
5. Sort the meal array by "extra_ingredients_count" in ascending order (meals with fewer extra ingredients should appear first).
6. For any ingredient not in the user's "Ingredients Available" list, add a note field with text: "This ingredient was not in your original list."

7. Search for well-known meals that match the criteria. If a well-known meal exists, use its recognized name; otherwise, generate a new, creative meal name.
8. Ensure that the step-by-step instructions are clear and easy to follow.
9. Include useful cooking tips specific to the recipe.
10. Add relevant tags like "quick," "budget-friendly," or "one-pot" to categorize the meal.
11. For the "country_origin" field, provide the specific country or region within the country (e.g., "Lebanon (South)" or "Northern Italy").
12. For the "original_language_name" field, provide the meal name in the original language of its country of origin.
13. For the "country_flag" field, provide an appropriate emoji flag representing the country of origin.
14. Only return the JSON arrayâ€”no additional text or explanations.

Output ONLY the completed JSON array without any additional text, prefixes, or labels. The response should start directly with the JSON array, like this: []. Do not include the word "json" or any other string before the array.
